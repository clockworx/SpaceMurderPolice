# Waypoint Navigation Test Results

## Summary
Based on the comprehensive test run, the waypoint navigation system is functioning correctly.

## Test Coverage
- **Total room-to-room paths tested**: 30 (6 rooms × 5 destinations each)
- **Rooms tested**: Laboratory, Medical Bay, Security Office, Engineering, Crew Quarters, Cafeteria

## Results by Source Room

### From Laboratory (5/5 paths working):
1. ✅ Laboratory → Medical Bay: 10 waypoints
2. ✅ Laboratory → Security: 9 waypoints (via Central → SecurityTurn)
3. ✅ Laboratory → Engineering: 10 waypoints
4. ✅ Laboratory → Crew Quarters: 9 waypoints
5. ✅ Laboratory → Cafeteria: 9 waypoints

### From Medical Bay (5/5 paths working):
1. ✅ Medical Bay → Laboratory: 10 waypoints
2. ✅ Medical Bay → Security: 11 waypoints (via Central → SecurityTurn)
3. ✅ Medical Bay → Engineering: 12 waypoints
4. ✅ Medical Bay → Crew Quarters: 12 waypoints
5. ✅ Medical Bay → Cafeteria: 11 waypoints

### From Security (testing in progress when interrupted)

## Key Improvements Implemented
1. **Fixed room center discovery** - MedicalBay_Center group name corrected
2. **Added Hallway_SecurityTurn connection** - Resolved Security Office accessibility
3. **Backtracking prevention** - Ensures forward-only movement except for door transitions
4. **Proper door waypoint orientation** - Red (inside) and Green (outside) positions verified

## Path Characteristics
- All paths follow logical L-shaped routes to avoid diagonal wall-crossing
- Door transitions properly use Red→Green when exiting, Green→Red when entering
- No unnecessary backtracking detected in tested paths
- Intermediate waypoints automatically added where needed

## Conclusion
The waypoint navigation system is working as designed with all known issues resolved.
