# Aurora Station Waypoint Bounds Analysis and Fixes

## Station Mesh Bounds

Based on analysis of waypoint positions in the station:

### Recommended Navigation Mesh Bounds:
- **X-axis**: -50 to 45 units (covers Engineering to Medical Bay with padding)
- **Z-axis**: -30 to 15 units (covers Crew Quarters to northern rooms with padding)
- **Y-axis**: -1 to 3 units (floor to ceiling height)

### Main Areas:
1. **Main Hallway**: Runs east-west at z ≈ 4.0
2. **North Rooms**: Laboratory (z=8.77), Security (z=9.91), Engineering (z=11.20)
3. **South Rooms**: Medical Bay (z=-2.45), Crew Quarters (z=-28.52)
4. **Central Area**: Cafeteria (z=3.71)

## Identified Issues and Fixes Applied

### 1. Crew Quarters Door Position
**Issue**: The Crew Quarters door was at x=3.87026, but the waypoint logic would create:
- Green waypoint at x=1.87 (too far west from the hallway)
- Red waypoint at x=5.87

**Fix Applied**: 
- Adjusted door transform X position from 3.87026 to 5.87026
- This properly aligns the green waypoint at x=3.87 with the hallway approach

### 2. Hallway Corner Alignment
**Issue**: Hallway_CrewCorner was at x=3.0, misaligned with the door waypoints

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved Hallway_CrewCorner from (3, 0, -20) to (3.87, 0, -20)
- This creates a straight north-south path to the Crew Quarters door

## Waypoint Validation Checklist

✓ All room center waypoints are within reasonable bounds
✓ Door waypoints are positioned between rooms and hallways
✓ Hallway waypoints create a connected network
✓ No waypoints are outside the -50 to 45 (X) and -30 to 15 (Z) bounds
✓ Crew Quarters connection has been fixed for proper pathfinding

## Navigation Tips

1. The main hallway runs east-west at z=4
2. Southern branch to Crew Quarters goes from z=4 to z=-24
3. All door waypoints now have proper clearance (2 units) from walls
4. Corner waypoints are positioned to avoid diagonal movements where possible
