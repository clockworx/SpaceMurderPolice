# Aurora Station Waypoint Analysis

## Station Bounds Analysis

Based on the waypoint positions extracted from the scene file:

### X-Axis Range:
- Westernmost: Engineering_Center at x = -45.271
- Easternmost: MedicalBay_Center at x = 42.5678
- Total X range: ~87.8 units

### Z-Axis Range:
- Main hallway runs along z = 4.0 (most hallway waypoints)
- Northernmost: Engineering_Center at z = 11.2007
- Southernmost: CrewQuarters_Center at z = -28.5239
- Total Z range: ~39.7 units

### Room Positions:
1. **Laboratory**: (-1.27, 0, 8.77) - North of main hallway
2. **Medical Bay**: (42.57, 0, -2.45) - Far east, slightly south
3. **Security**: (-13.86, 0, 9.91) - Northwest area
4. **Engineering**: (-45.27, 0, 11.20) - Far west, north
5. **Crew Quarters**: (-5.40, 0, -28.52) - Central, far south
6. **Cafeteria**: (6.0, 0, 3.71) - Central, near main hallway

### Main Hallway Points:
- Runs primarily at z = 4.0
- X range: from -24.54 (Hallway_West) to 38.71 (Hallway_MedicalApproach)
- South branch: Goes down to z = -23.74 (Hallway_CrewTurn)

## Problematic Waypoints

Based on the layout analysis, the following waypoints appear to be outside reasonable bounds:

1. **Crew_Door_Green** (if at z = -24.0289):
   - This is only 4.5 units from CrewQuarters_Center
   - Should likely be around z = -20 to -22 (between hallway and room)

2. **Any waypoints with z < -30 or z > 15**:
   - Would be outside the reasonable station bounds

3. **Any waypoints with x < -50 or x > 45**:
   - Would be beyond the east-west extent of the station

## Recommended Station Mesh Bounds

For the navigation mesh, reasonable bounds would be:
- X-axis: -50 to 45 (with 5-unit padding)
- Z-axis: -30 to 15 (with 2-unit padding)
- Y-axis: -1 to 3 (typical floor to ceiling height)

## Waypoint Corrections Needed

1. Check all door waypoints to ensure they're between their room and the hallway
2. Verify no waypoints are floating outside these bounds
3. Ensure door waypoints have proper clearance (at least 2 units from walls)
