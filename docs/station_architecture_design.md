# Aurora Station - Realistic Space Station Architecture

## Design Principles
- **Modular Construction**: Built from standardized 8x8m habitat modules
- **Enclosed Environment**: No open spaces or fall hazards - everything is pressurized
- **Functional Zoning**: Departments grouped logically with proper circulation
- **Emergency Access**: Multiple routes between critical areas
- **Service Infrastructure**: Maintenance tunnels run parallel to main corridors

## Station Layout

### Central Spine (Main Corridor)
- **Width**: 4 meters (allows two-way traffic + emergency equipment)
- **Height**: 3 meters (standard for space stations)
- **Length**: 80 meters total
- **Features**: Emergency lighting strips, handrails, equipment lockers every 20m

### Module Organization

#### Section A: Command & Control (Z: 30 to 40)
- **Security Center** (10x12m): Main security office with holding cells
- **Communications Hub** (8x8m): Station comms and external contact
- **Airlock Access** (6x8m): Docking port control

#### Section B: Science Labs (Z: 10 to 30)
- **Laboratory 1** (12x10m): Primary research lab
- **Laboratory 2** (10x10m): Secondary research
- **Laboratory 3** (12x10m): Where the crime occurred
- **Lab Storage** (6x6m): Chemical and equipment storage

#### Section C: Medical (Z: -10 to 10)
- **Medical Bay** (12x10m): Main treatment area
- **Surgery Suite** (8x8m): Sterile operating room
- **Recovery Ward** (8x8m): Patient beds
- **Medical Storage** (6x6m): Supplies and pharmaceuticals

#### Section D: Crew Support (Z: -30 to -10)
- **Cafeteria** (14x12m): Dining and food prep
- **Recreation Room** (10x10m): Off-duty area
- **Fitness Center** (8x10m): Exercise equipment

#### Section E: Crew Quarters (Z: -50 to -30)
- **Quarters Block A** (16x8m): 4 individual rooms
- **Quarters Block B** (16x8m): 4 individual rooms
- **Shared Facilities** (8x6m): Bathrooms and showers

#### Section F: Engineering (Z: -70 to -50)
- **Main Engineering** (14x12m): Power and life support
- **Engineering Storage** (8x8m): Parts and tools
- **Maintenance Shop** (8x8m): Repair workspace

### Cross Corridors
- **Width**: 3 meters
- **Locations**: Z = -40, -20, 0, 20
- **Purpose**: Connect port/starboard modules to central spine

### Maintenance Tunnel Network
- **Width**: 2 meters
- **Height**: 2.2 meters
- **Access Points**: Every 20m along main corridors
- **Features**: Service panels, emergency supplies, alternate routes

## Safety Features
1. **Bulkheads**: Pressure doors every 20m that can seal sections
2. **Emergency Lighting**: Red strips activate during alerts
3. **Life Support Redundancy**: Each section has backup systems
4. **Escape Pods**: Located at Z = 40 and Z = -60

## Navigation Flow
- **Primary Routes**: Central spine + cross corridors
- **Secondary Routes**: Maintenance tunnels
- **Emergency Routes**: Direct paths to escape pods marked in red
- **Signage**: Clear section markers and directional indicators

## Construction Method
1. Build central spine first (fully enclosed tube)
2. Attach cross corridors at junction points
3. Connect habitat modules to corridors
4. Install maintenance tunnel network
5. Add all safety systems and lighting
