# Navigation System Cleanup Complete

## Debug Output Cleanup
All verbose print statements have been commented out in the waypoint navigation system to reduce console spam.

### Files Modified:
1. **scripts/npcs/npc_base.gd**
   - Commented out 18 print statements
   - Fixed syntax error in commented print statement (extra quote)
   - Added `pass` statements to empty blocks:
     - `_setup_waypoint_movement()` function
     - `if debug_state_changes:` block
     - Sound detection if/else blocks
   - Commented out debug for loop that was only printing waypoint information

2. **scripts/managers/waypoint_network_manager.gd**
   - Commented out 30 print statements  
   - Added `pass` statements to empty blocks:
     - Room center discovery else block
     - Diagonal detection if block
     - Waypoint not found else block
     - Backtrack detection if block
     - Station bounds validation if blocks (2)
     - Invalid connection else block
     - Unreachable pairs if/else blocks
     - Out of bounds if/else blocks

## Parse Errors Fixed:
- Fixed syntax error in comment: `waypoint_path[i]")` â†’ `waypoint_path[i])`
- Fixed all empty function bodies and control blocks
- Added pass statements where needed to satisfy Python/GDScript syntax

## Result:
The navigation system is now:
- Free of verbose debug output
- Ready for GitHub commit
- All parse errors resolved
- Functionality preserved while removing noise from console

The waypoint-based navigation system remains fully functional with clean, production-ready code.
